{aws} has launched an improved contribution experience for the EKS User Guide.

You can now edit the EKS User Guide source directly on GitHub. 

The docs now use AsciiDoc, a powerful authoring language similar to markdown. AsciiDoc combines simple syntax with enterprise documentation features like advanced formatting, cross-referencing, and security controls.

You can now edit the EKS Docs directly on GitHub. Our streamlined process includes:

* Faster pull request processing
* Reduced manual steps 
* Automated content quality checks

We look forward to your contributions.

*To edit a single page from a web browser*

. Navigate to the page in the EKS User Guide
. Select *Edit this page on GitHub* in the right sidebar
. Open the GitHub editor: press `e` or select *Edit in Place* from the pencil icon dropdown menu
. Make your edits, and then select *Commit changes...*
** Confirm your email and include a short description of the changes
